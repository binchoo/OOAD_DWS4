# Test specification for Siena HierarchicalDispatcher "application"
#
# This specification is designed to test methods publish(SENPPacket),
# subscribe(SENPPacket), unsubscribe(SENPPacket) and unsubscribe(Notifiable)
# of interface Siena, which is implemented by class HierarchicalDispatcher.
#
# In this specification, an instance of HierarchicalDispatcher is called a
# "server", any non-server entity interacting with a server (including a
# test program) is called a "client" or a "pub" (for publisher) or a
# "sub" (for subscriber), and an attribute is called an "attr".  A "matching
# pub" is a publisher whose notifications match the subscriber's subscriptions,
# while a "non-matching pub" is a publisher whose notifcations do not match
# the subscriber's subscriptions.
